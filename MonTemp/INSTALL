Prerequisites

Make sure you have python3, numpy and matplotlib installed on
your system. If you are using python 2 by default in your system then
you may need to install specifically the libraries specifically for
python3.

To install:

1) mkdir ~/.myPrograms (if it doesn't already exist)
2) cd ~/.myPrograms
3) Make sure that ModTemp.sh is an executable
4) ln -s route/directory/for/ModTemp.sh TempModule
5) Add the following line at the end of your .bashrc (or .zshrc ...):

             export PATH=$PATH:~/.myPrograms

Any new terminal (or after sourcing the current one) should be able to
run TempModule.

To run TempModule a configuration file must be provided as argument.

To execute TempModule type:

TempModule route/directory/for/config_file
