# TemperatureMonitor

This program can be used to aquire the data of a temperature monitor
LakeShore 218. 

Thorugh .sh file you can install it and execute it from terminal (see INSTALL).

Data is storage in 2 text files: a file contains data and the other contains
the data averaged.

Also, .pck files (pickle files) contains raw data. A program to recover them 
is being developed.

Now, we have made another version of the program to read from two modules at the same time.
To run the program two config_files are needed, onee for each module.

During this development some bugs and functionalities has been added to the original program and to the new one.
